# Python-MiniProjects
## Hello Paarth here!
This is a short repository for my Python projects I'm doing over the summer in my Python for Data Science course at IIT Kanpur

This is just meant for me to get used to Python basics and learn how to use GitHub on the way!

**_Feel free to use any programs if you're also learning Python! I'm not maintaining any licenses on this repository_**
