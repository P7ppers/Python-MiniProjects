# Python-MiniProjects
## Hello Paarth here!
This is a short repository for my Python projects I'm doing over the summer in my Python for Data Science course at IIT Kanpur

This is just meant for me to get used to Python basics and learn how to use GitHub on the way!

# Updates
Added my first file working with python dictionaries - EmployeeManagementSystem.py on 7/23/2024
